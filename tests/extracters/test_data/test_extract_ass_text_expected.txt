老友记
第一季第一集
没人告诉你生活会是这样
So no one told you life was gonna be this way
你滑稽的工作  你的差劲
your jobs a joke, you're broke,
你半途而废的爱情
your love life's D.O.A.
就像开车卡在二档
It's like you're always stuck in second gear,
每日每周每月
And it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,
甚至每年都是如此
or even your year, but
大雨倾盆时
I'll be there for you,
我会陪伴你
when the rain starts to pour.
我会陪伴你
I'll be there for you,
像我以前那样
like I've been there before.
我会陪伴你
I'll be there for you,
因为你也陪伴着我
'cause you're there for me too.
